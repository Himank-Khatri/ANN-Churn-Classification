# Customer Churn Prediction using Artificial Neural Network

This repository contains a machine learning model built using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to predict customer churn based on various features.

## Files

- **app.py**: The Streamlit app for user interaction and predictions.
- **experiments.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook for model training and experimentation.
- **requirements.txt**: Lists all necessary dependencies.
- **artifacts**: Folder containing saved models and encoders.
- **dataset**: Folder containing the dataset used for training the model.

## Project Description

The model predicts whether a customer is likely to churn based on features such as:
- Geography
- Gender
- Age
- Balance
- Credit Score
- Estimated Salary
- Tenure
- Number of Products
- Whether the customer has a credit card
- Whether the customer is an active member

## How to Run the Application

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Himank-Khatri/ANN-Churn-Classification.git
